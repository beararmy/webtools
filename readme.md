Some small tools to do mostly useless stuff

# Overtime-by-the-second

Quick script that will show you how much you've earned with a given rate and a given start time.

- `$startDate` - Feed in a datetime when your overtime shift has started
- `$hourlyRate` - 00.00 format hourly rate in your local currency
- `$keeprefreshing` - bool to periodically refresh the output

# BSAC-Training-Scraper

Hacky tool to scrape the BSAC training events website to catch new training events.
- [ ] Needs re-work, currently pretty hideous

# 95pc-mortgage-checker

Mostly a scraper to be used as an Azure automation runbook to check for availability of 95% mortgages

- Negative: Some sites show words stating they are NOT offering 95pc
- Positive: Some sites show a list of what they ARE offering
